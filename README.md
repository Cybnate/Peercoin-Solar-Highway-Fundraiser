Fundraiser for Indiegogo Solar Highway (Target 250PPC)

This project is created to raise funds for the solar panel highway through peer4commit
Charter for Fundraising for Solar highway – Target 250 PPC (~$500)

Project overview:

Solar Roadways is a modular paving system of solar panels that can withstand the heaviest of trucks (250,000 pounds). These Solar Road Panels can be installed on roads, parking lots, driveways, sidewalks, bike paths, playgrounds... literally any surface under the sun. They pay for themselves primarily through the generation of electricity, which can power homes and businesses connected via driveways and parking lots. A nationwide system could produce more clean renewable energy than a country uses as a whole (http://solarroadways.com/numbers.shtml). They have many other features as well, including: heating elements to stay snow/ice free, LEDs to make road lines and signage, and attached Cable Corridor to store and treat stormwater and provide a "home" for power and data cables. EVs will be able to charge with energy from the sun (instead of fossil fuels) from parking lots and driveways and after a roadway system is in place, mutual induction technology will allow for charging while driving. 

Solar Roadways has received two phases of funding from the U.S. Federal Highway Administration for research and development of a paving system that will pay for itself over its lifespan. We are about to wrap up our Phase II contract (to build a prototype parking lot) and now need to raise funding for production.

Scope of fundraising Peercoin community:

Fundraising is to obtain one (target) or more (stretch-target) of the $500 perks as a community. With that perk we earn the right to have a text engraved onto the mounting hole covers of the panels on the demo solar parking lot. We will also get some pictures which we can use for future marketing. With a bit of luck the Indiegogo project will also get a bit of press coverage which we might be able to leverage upon depending on out contribution.


Details:

-	We assume PPC/US$ rate of $2,00 to be on safe side. First target is 250 PPC. 
-	First stretch target is 50 PPC for the 30 second ‘Thank you video’ where we can include some specific message from the Peercoin community if desired. Suggestions for this text need to be submitted by email at the same time as the contribution. The proposed text needs to be determined in the peercointalk thread for this fundraiser.
The video will be send to us asap and can be used in social media.
-	Further stretch targets are another 250 PPC for mounting hole covers.
-	Funding is to be raised through peer4commit.com and only in Peercoins (PPC)
-	Fundraiser closes on 29 May 12.00 UTC (~2 days before the Indiegogo project closes) to allow for conversion. When the target and first stretch target are reached before the end date, the fundraiser will endeavour to transfer the funds
-	The proposal is to have Peercoin engraved or if possible the Peercoin logo and the name Peercoin. Other special requests can be discussed in the peercointalk thread for this fundraiser
-	Any remaining funds will go to the project as general contribution under the “Thank you’ perk.


Release of funds:

The release of funds will be through peer4commit.com by manually draining the fund.
Given the current restraints on peer4commit.com of releasing the total fund or larger than 5% chunks of it, the project maintainer have to manually drain the fund with multiple transactions in Peer4commit before transferring it as one payment. The payment will be transferred to an address of the chosen exchange. From here on they are converted into fiat as that is the only method of payment accepted. 
Any remaining raised funds which still exist or a reason after the Indiegogo fundraiser closed will be transferred to the peerunity project on peer4commit.com. This may happen when the value of Peercoin increases in the time between the fundraiser closing and the transfer of the funds or the funds haven’t been transferred in time.
Any questions can be posted on peercointalk.org or raised as an issue on the repo on Github.
The project maintainer will try to respond questions within 48 hours or indicate that an answer is underway but might take a bit more time.
